# Plugins to try
- esmuellert/nvim-eslint: Better than eslint-lsp, according to JohnV.

# Tweaks
- Fix 'o' in mini.files to avoid key conflict
- "ripgrep" and "find files" shortcuts that scope to the dir of the current file
- Tweak terminal shortcuts:
  - Make it easier to show/hide existing terminals without changing their dock location.
  - Figure out why h/v behave oddly in terminal mode
  - <leader>t[123]t: toggle existing placement
